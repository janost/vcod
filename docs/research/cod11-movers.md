# CoD 1.1 MP: the scriptent mover verbs

What `moveto`, `movex`/`movey`/`movez`, `movegravity`, `rotateto`,
`rotatepitch`/`rotateyaw`/`rotateroll` and `rotatevelocity` do, in what units,
and what they put on the wire.

The evidence is one paired capture against the retail 1.1d Linux dedicated
server, mp_pavlov under `dm`, 2026-09-09:

- `crates/server/tests/fixtures/movers/mp_pavlov-dm-movers.txt`, the server
  half: `getorigin()` and `.angles` once per server frame through each verb,
  logged by `crates/gsc/tests/fixtures/semantics/client-probes/probe_mover.gsc`
  under `tools/run_probe.sh`;
- `crates/server/tests/fixtures/movers/mp_pavlov-dm-movers-wire.txt`, the
  client half: every change to an entity's `pos`/`apos` trajectory group, from
  a `--net-probe` attached to that same server.

The verb-to-handler mapping is the `scriptent` method table at
`game.mp.i386.so` `0x78d40`, walked by `ScriptEnt_GetMethod` (`0x60f60`), and
is in `docs/research/cod11-gsc-object-model.md` section 9. The trajectory
enumeration is `docs/protocol-1.1.md`, divergence 8.

## 1. Which entities accept a mover verb

Only three classnames. VERIFIED: a `movez` on a `mpweapon_panzerfaust` is the
fatal

```
entity 258 is not a script_brushmodel, script_model, or script_origin
```

so the mover verbs are gated on the entity's spawn class and the gate is a
script runtime error, not a silent no-op. That cost the probe one run.

## 2. The time argument is seconds

VERIFIED. `moveto((600,0,100), 1)` from `(100,0,100)` took 1000 ms of level
clock and `moveto((600,0,100), 2)` took 2000, measured between the frame the
origin first moved and the frame `movedone` fired. A frame or millisecond
reading of the same argument would have finished inside one frame.

## 3. The axis verbs are deltas; the target verbs are absolute

VERIFIED. `movex(500, 2)` on an entity at `x = 100` ended at `x = 600`, and
`moveto((600,0,100), 2)` from the same start ended at the same place, so one
argument is a displacement and the other a destination.

VERIFIED for the angular half too, and it needed a second call to see: a
single `rotateyaw(90, 2)` on an entity at yaw 0 is ambiguous, so the probe
calls it twice. The second call ran the yaw from 90 to 180, so
`rotatepitch`/`rotateyaw`/`rotateroll` are deltas and `rotateto` takes an
absolute angle set.

## 4. The motion law: a trapezoidal velocity profile

`moveto`/`movex`/`movey`/`movez` and `rotateto`/`rotatepitch`/`rotateyaw`/
`rotateroll` take an optional `accel` and `decel` after the duration, both in
**seconds of ramp**, and both default to 0.

VERIFIED from the per-frame origins. For a move of distance `D` over `T`
seconds with ramps `ta` and `td`, the cruise speed is

```
v = D / (T - ta/2 - td/2)
```

the first `ta` seconds are constant acceleration from 0 to `v`, the last `td`
seconds constant deceleration from `v` to 0, and the middle is `v`. Three
measured cases agree to the sampled digit:

| verb | D | T | ta | td | v predicted | v measured |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `moveto` | 500 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 500 u/s | 500 u/s (25.00 per 50 ms frame) |
| `moveto` | 500 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 250 u/s | 250 u/s (12.50 per frame) |
| `moveto` | 500 | 2 | 0.5 | 0.5 | 333.33 u/s | 333.33 u/s (16.67 per frame) |
| `moveto` | 500 | 2 | 0.5 | 0 | 285.71 u/s | 285.71 u/s (14.29 per frame) |
| `rotateto` | 90 deg | 2 | 0.5 | 0.5 | 60 deg/s | 60 deg/s (3.00 per frame) |

The accel-only row is what says the two ends are independent rather than one
symmetric ease. The ramp itself is exact constant acceleration: with
`ta = 0.5` and `v = 333.33` the displacement at 50 ms is 0.83 units, which is
`½ (v/ta) t²` to the sampled digit, not a smoothstep.

With no ramps the motion is linear, and the entity is at its destination on
the frame `movedone` fires.

## 5. `movegravity`

VERIFIED. `movegravity((0,0,300), 3)` from `z = 100` traced
`z(t) = 100 + 300t - 400t²` exactly, peaking at 156.25 at t = 0.375 and
reading -2600.00 at t = 3. So the vector is an initial velocity in units per
second and gravity is 800 u/s², the `DEFAULT_GRAVITY` the trajectory code
already carries (`crates/common/src/net/trajectory.rs`).

The time argument is when `movedone` fires, not when the motion stops: the
entity was still accelerating downward on the frame the notify came. Whether
it stops there or keeps falling is UNVERIFIED; the probe's sampler ran out on
the same frame.

## 6. `rotatevelocity`

VERIFIED. `rotatevelocity((0,180,0), 2, 0, 0)` turned the yaw at 9 degrees per
50 ms frame, 180 deg/s, for exactly 2 seconds, ending back at 0 after a full
turn, and raised `rotatedone`. So the vector is an angular velocity in degrees
per second and the second argument is a duration; the accel and decel
arguments are the same pair section 4 measures.

## 7. The completion notifies

VERIFIED. The four linear families and `movegravity` raise `"movedone"`; the
four angular families and `rotatevelocity` raise `"rotatedone"`. Each fires on
the frame the duration elapses, on the entity itself.

## 8. Script-visible state while a mover runs

VERIFIED. `getorigin()` returns the interpolated position on every frame of a
move, and `.angles` reads the interpolated angles on every frame of a rotate
— the field is written back, not left at the value it had when the verb was
called. `.angles` is normalized: after `rotatevelocity` turned a full 360 it
read `(0, 0, 0)` while the wire carried 360 (section 9).

Whether `.origin` is written back the same way is UNVERIFIED; the probe read
`getorigin()`.

**Script sees the trajectory one server frame late.** VERIFIED, from both
halves of the capture at once. `moveto((600,0,100), 1)` called at level time
1050 put `trTime` 1050 on the wire, and yet `getorigin()` still read the start
origin at 1100 and the first moved value, 125, at 1150; `movedone` came at
2100 rather than at 1050 + 1000. Every phase agrees: `rotateyaw(90, 2)` called
at 13450 raised `rotatedone` at 15500. So the script-visible origin and angles
at level time `T` are the trajectory evaluated at `T - 50`, one frame at the
default `sv_fps` 20, and the completion notify comes on the first frame whose
lagged clock has passed the end. Whether the lag is one frame or a fixed 50 ms
is UNVERIFIED; the capture ran at one frame rate.

## 9. What goes on the wire

VERIFIED, and this is the load-bearing one: retail sends **a trajectory the
client extrapolates**, not per-frame origins. A two-second move is two
snapshot updates, one at each end, and nothing in between, whatever the frame
rate.

Per verb, with the `trType_t` enumeration from
`crates/common/src/net/trajectory.rs`:

| verb | group | at the call | at the end |
|---|---|---|---|
| `moveto`/`movex`/`movey`/`movez`, no ramps | `pos` | `trType` 3 (`TR_LINEAR_STOP`), `trTime` = the level time of the call, `trDuration` = the duration in ms, `trBase` = the start origin, `trDelta` = the velocity in units/s | `trType` 0, `trBase` = the end origin, `trTime` = the completion time. `trDelta` and `trDuration` are left stale |
| the same with ramps | `pos` | three consecutive trajectories, one per segment: `trType` 9 (`TR_ACCELERATE`) for `trDuration` = `ta` ms, then `trType` 3 for the cruise, then `trType` 10 (`TR_DECCELERATE`) for `td` ms. Every one carries `trDelta` = the cruise velocity `v` and a `trBase` at that segment's own start | `trType` 0 at the end origin |
| `movegravity` | `pos` | `trType` 5 (`TR_GRAVITY`), `trDuration` = the duration in ms, `trDelta` = the initial velocity | not observed; the probe deleted the entity first |
| `rotateto`/`rotatepitch`/`rotateyaw`/`rotateroll`/`rotatevelocity` | `apos` | `trType` 3, `trDelta` = the angular velocity in deg/s | `trType` 0 with `trBase` = the angle reached, unnormalized: a full turn read `(0, 360, 0)` |

The measured example: `movez(96, 2, 0.5, 0.5)` from `z = 592` sent
`trType 9, trDuration 500, base z 592, delta z 64`, then
`trType 3, trDuration 1000, base z 608, delta z 64`, then
`trType 10, trDuration 500, base z 672, delta z 64`, then
`trType 0, base z 688`. The three segments cover 16, 64 and 16 units, and 64
is the cruise speed section 4's formula gives for `96 / (2 - 0.25 - 0.25)`.

A mover is an `eType` 8 (`ET_SCRIPTMOVER`) entity throughout; nothing about
the entity kind changes when it starts or stops moving.

## 10. What is not measured here

- Whether a second verb on an entity already moving replaces the trajectory,
  queues behind it, or is an error.
- What `movegravity` leaves the entity doing after its `movedone`.
- Whether `.origin` is written back per frame.
- The moving clip: whether a `script_brushmodel`'s brushes follow its
  trajectory, and against which trace kinds. mp_pavlov's two are deleted by
  `_gameobjects` under `dm`, so this capture has none.
